    <p class="clanAbout">
      Established in 2016, we have since then cultivated a sense of family, a
      firm support system, people who want to be a better version of themselves
      everyday, in every way. The thought in itself that something so grand
      started from just an idea of a brotherhood, eventually formed a family of
      unbreakable bonds. Every isnt meant to be apart of the IxAM family, its ok
      to be affiliated. What important to take away is that what ever makes you
      a better version, is the route you should take
